        <p>My name is Nicholas Chan. I am originally from Los Angeles, California. I enjoy motorcycles, rockhounding, wild edible foraging, camping, traveling, computer games, movies, and mostly anything sci-fi or fantasy-related. 
        </p>

        <p>My previous career was in Recreation Therapy, where I used recreation as my medium of therapy. I spent 6 years working and perfecting my skills in the field in an acute psychiatric facility. Using recreation therapy, I helped rehabilitate patients with mental illnesses or disorders, improving their quality of life. However, I slowly began to discover that I wanted to pursue a career I truly enjoyed. 
        </p>

        <p>Enter UC Berkeley Extension. They offered a coding bootcamp; an intense full-time course that taught programming. I spent my entire life on the computer. Whether it was for leisure or for work, I was constantly hammering away on a keyboard. I realized that this was something worth pursuing, combining my work and my leisure into one. I dropped everything and moved away from my home in Los Angeles to the Bay Area. Being able to live nomadically helped out tremendously, making the transition relatively easy. Since then, I have been diligently working at the UC Berkeley coding bootcamp.</p>
